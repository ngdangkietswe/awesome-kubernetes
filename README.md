# Kubernetes (K8S)

- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and managing of containerized applications


## Origins

- K8S is based on Google Borg, the internal system that Google has been using for many years to offer access to its applications

- Borg was also the origin of important Linux kernel features, used in containers nowadays, such as namespaces

- Google donated the Borg specification to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which was the start of Kubernetes
